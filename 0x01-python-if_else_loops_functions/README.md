## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  * 0-positive_or_negative.py: Python program that assigns
  a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and
  prints whether `number` is positive or negative.
  

* **1. The last digit**
  * 1-last_digit: Python program that assigns a random signed number
  to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints its last digit.

* **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  * 2-print_alphabet.py: Python program that prints the alphabet
  in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

* **3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
  * 3-print_alphabt.py: Python program that prints the
  alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

* **4. Hexadecimal printing**
  * 4-print_hexa.py: Python program that prints all numbers from
  `0` to `98` in decimal and hexadecimal.

* **5. 00...99**
  * 5-print_comb2.py: Python program that prints numbers from `0`
  to `99` two digits each.

* **6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
  * 6-print_comb3.py: Python program that prints all possible
  different combinations of two digits in ascending order.

* **7. islower**
  * 7-islower.py: Python function that checks for lowercase characters.
 

* **8. To uppercase**
  * 8-uppercase.py: Python function that prints a string in
  uppercase followed by a new line.

* **9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; its what we do with them that's important**
  * 9-print_last_digit.py: Python function that prints the last
  digit of a number.

* **10. a + b**
  * 10-add.py: Python function that returns the addition of two integers.
  

* **11. a ^ b**
  * 11-pow.py: Python function that returns `a` to the power of `b`.
  

* **12. Fizz Buzz**
  * 12-fizzbuzz.py: Python function that prints the numbers from
  `1` to `100` followed by a space.
  
* **13. Insert in sorted linked list**
  * 13-insert_number.c: C function that inserts a number
  into a sorted linked list.
  
* **14. Smile in the mirror**
  * 100-print_tebahpla.py: Python program that prints the alphabet
  in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase, not followed by a new line.
  

* **15. Remove at position**
  * 101-remove_char_at.py: Python function that
  creates a copy of a string without the character at position `n`.
  

* **16. ByteCode -> Python #2**
  * 102-magic_calculation.py: Python function matching exactly a
  bytecode provided by Holberton School.
